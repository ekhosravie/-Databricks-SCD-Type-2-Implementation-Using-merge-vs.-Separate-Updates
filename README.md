Databricks SCD Type 2 Implementation: Using merge vs. Separate Updates

Scenario:

Hub table (customer_hub) stores customer details.

SCD Type 2 table (customer_scd) tracks historical address changes.

Updates come in a CSV file (customer_updates.csv).



Key Points:

merge is suitable for SCD Type 1 or when you only need the latest values.

SCD Type 2 mandates a separate table to preserve history.

Joins and updates (without merge) are often better for SCD Type 2 in data vaults.

Choose the appropriate method based on your specific business requirements and SCD type.



Choosing the Right Approach for Historical Data Tracking



This code demonstrates two approaches to handling data updates in a Databricks data vault context, specifically focusing on SCD Type 2 scenarios. SCD Type 2 requires maintaining a complete history of changes for specific attributes (e.g., customer addresses).



The code highlights the appropriate use cases for each approach:



1. When to Use merge (SCD Type 1):

The merge statement is suitable for attributes where only the latest value is needed. The code snippet demonstrates how to efficiently update the customer hub table directly with the latest information from the update source.



2. When Not to Use merge (SCD Type 2):

For attributes requiring full historical tracking, like customer addresses in this example, merge is not ideal. The code showcases an alternative approach using joins and separate updates:

Customer updates are joined with the existing hub table to identify current and historical records.



The current address is used to update the hub table (without merge).

Historical addresses are written to a separate SCD table, including start and end dates for each record.



Key Takeaways:

Selecting the appropriate method depends on your specific business requirements.



SCD Type 1 scenarios often benefit from merge for efficient updates.

SCD Type 2 scenarios typically require separate SCD tables to preserve historical data.



Consider factors like data integrity, compliance needs, and desired level of historical detail when choosing your approach.
